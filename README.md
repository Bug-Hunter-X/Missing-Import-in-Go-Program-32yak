# Missing Import in Go Program

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go: forgetting to import the necessary packages.  The `bug.go` file shows the error, and `bugSolution.go` provides the corrected code.

This is a simple example, but the principle applies to more complex situations where forgetting to import a package can lead to compilation errors or runtime panics.  Always double-check your imports!
